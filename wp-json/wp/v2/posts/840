The units will be shipped in June for immediate use on vessels operating in the Galapagos maritime territory.<\/p>\n<p>The Galapagos Islands, which are a province of Ecuador, are located 650 miles from the Ecuador coast and have a highly sensitive and unique environment, which is subject to strict protection. Vessels are only permitted to operate in certain areas at specific times. In 2012, the authorities of the islands determined that all boats operating in their waters should be tracked and monitored to ensure compliance with operating regulations. A system of AIS base stations was installed in 2013 and a regulation drafted and enacted requiring local and visiting vessels to be fitted with an AIS transceiver to enable authorities to monitor and regulate movements. The Identifier transceivers were tested and evaluated over the course of a year, during which they met all requirements with a recorded system tracking the range of up to 180 miles due to the height of the AIS base stations.<\/p>\n<p>Simon Tucker, SRT CEO said: \u201cThe order from the Galapagos Islands is in line with the global trend of authorities seeking to monitor their maritime domains using AIS. The Identifier was developed specifically for small fishing boat monitoring and so were perfect for this project. I am delighted that SRT\u2019s products will be playing an active long-term role in protecting this valuable and unique habitat. Although a small order, the Galapagos is an excellent showcase for the pending Ecuador fishing fleet monitoring project with up to 20,000 vessels, and the wider South American market.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Monitoring of fishing vessels for marine conservation SRT, the AIM-quoted provider of maritime domain awareness technologies, products and solutions, is pleased to announce that it has received an order for 410 Identifier AIS transceivers and a GeoVS VIEWER display system for deployment in the Galapagos Islands.
