SRT understands that the initial requirement under the mandate is for Class A devices and that it will affect an estimated 4,000 vessels over the next one to two years with a further 25,000 vessels expected to require a mixture of Class A and B devices within the five year timeframe.<\/p>\n<p>SRT\u2019s standard GPS based AIS Class A and Class B units have been customised for Transas to include the Russian operated positioning system, GLONAS, and other features and functions required by local regulations. This work was completed between November 2011 and March 2012 and the first units delivered to Transas earlier this month for in-house functional testing and formal testing and approval by relevant Russian marine and radio authorities. The approval process is ongoing and is expected to take up to five months. During this period SRT will commence the production planning and manufacture of the first GLONAS Class A units ready for delivery towards the end of Q2 in financial year 2012\/13.<\/p>\n<p>Transas is based in St. Petersburg and is Russia\u2019s largest marine electronics company with a well-established, dominant market share through its nationwide dealer network.<\/p>\n<p>Simon Tucker, SRT CEO said; \u201cTransas is the dominant player in the Russian marine market with a market share which we estimate at over 80%. This mandate has created a substantial market opportunity and our partnership provides Transas with the product it needs to supply the resulting demand. As with other markets we expect that this mandate is the beginning of the Russian AIS programme which will present other opportunities for our broadening product range.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Software Radio Technology plc (\u201cSRT\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) is pleased to announce that it has signed an AIS supply agreement with Transas Navigator (\u201cTransas\u201d) of Russia with an initial frame order for Class A products worth US$1.25 million which is expected to be delivered over the next twelve months in minimum call-offs of US$250,000.
