However many vessels, both large and small, frequently operate outside the detection range of such systems. The ability to reliably receive AIS transmissions from Class B and Identifier type transceivers from space and therefore without coastal range limitations will enable countries to significantly improve their vessel monitoring capabilities.<\/p>\n<p>Simon Tucker said; \u201cThis is an important strategic step for both exactEarth and SRT which will provide the market with a uniquely capable AIS based tracking system solution. The technology that we are developing with our new partner is complex and will take the time to perfect, but has already demonstrated a meaningful improvement in standard satellite reception capability. We expect the partnership to enable SRT to develop recurring revenue flows linked to the supply of data via a range of applications and services in the future.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis relationship puts the leaders in satellite AIS detection technology together with the leaders in high-performance AIS transponder technology to solve the problem of reliably detecting low-cost AIS transponders from space\u201d, said Peter Mabson President of exactEarth. \u201cI am very excited by the potential of this relationship to significantly increase the global population of deployed AIS products that we track with our exactEarth satellite constellation and very happy to have formalised our working relationship with the SRT team.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>About exactEarth:<br \/>\nexactEarth, based in Cambridge, Ontario, is a data services company providing the most advanced information on global maritime traffic available today.
