An important part of the programme is the implementation of technologies which provide the Panama Canal operators with enhanced situational awareness and control. The Dynamic 3D display visualisation of GeoVS, coupled with its broad VTS functionality, delivers significantly enhanced situational awareness for operators and will be used to monitor and control vessel activity through the canal. SRT expects the system will be installed and fully operational before the end of 2016.<\/p>\n<p>Simon Tucker, SRT CEO said: \u201cThe Panama Canal is one of the busiest and most complex waterways in the world and thus vessel traffic operators and controllers must have optimal real time situational awareness at all times. SRT\u2019s GeoVS VTS system delivers a range of functionality, including Dynamic 3D visualisation, which ensures controllers and operators have an accurate and dynamic digital visualisation of real time activities throughout the canal and related infrastructure. We are delighted to have been selected by such a prestigious marine authority to supply mission critical maritime domain monitoring technology and look forward to working with them in the future.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>SRT, the global provider of maritime tracking technologies, products and turn-key system solutions, is pleased to announce that it has been awarded a contract to supply the Panama Canal with its GeoVS maritime display and data management VTS system.
