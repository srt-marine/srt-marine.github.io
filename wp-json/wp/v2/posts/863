The orders are from longstanding existing customers who have been actively selling SRT\u2019s AIS products for a number of years.<\/p>\n<p>Simon Tucker, Chief Executive Officer of SRT, said \u201cThis is a demonstration of how the global AIS market is growing. AIS is now an established marine technology and with only a very small proportion of the global vessel fleet fitted so far and momentum building, I expect we will see more of the same in the future. As the world\u2019s leading supplier of AIS technology and products, SRT\u2019s challenge will be to continue to be a reliable supplier to our growing customer base who are addressing a growing and very diverse range of markets. I believe the team we have assembled and the investments we have made over the last five years will enable us to meet that challenge.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>US$7 Million Orders Received\u00a0 Software Radio Technology plc (\u201cSRT\u201d) is pleased to announce that it has received frame orders worth over US$7 million from customers located in North America.
