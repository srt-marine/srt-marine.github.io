The contract is for the initial phase of a long-term programme with additional phases expected in the future.<\/p>\n<p>The customer is a national authority, and the MDM system will provide a national scale maritime monitoring and management capability. This will enable authorities to enhance the security, safety and management of their marine environment through the identification of potential threats, prevention of illegal fishing, management of sensitive marine areas and enhancement of search and rescue capability.<\/p>\n<p>The MDM system includes the supply of a full GeoVS data management and multi-node viewing system with terrestrial and optional ABSEA AIS satellite data fusion capability for long-range tracking, AIS coast stations and thousands of AIS transceivers enabled with anti-tamper features. The system will create a national maritime database of the vessel and other marine related information which can be viewed, mined and developed by multiple stakeholders, such as the Coast Guard, Fisheries, Police, Navy and Environment ministries to expand and enhance their operations. The system will also integrate and enhance existing surveillance systems.<\/p>\n<p>The system will enable accurate, real-time tracking of all vessels of any size and type without range limitation through the fusion of terrestrial and optional ABSEA AIS satellite data feeds. Full vessel ownership and operator details will be maintained and continuously updated with live data along with other relevant information such as their licence status. The GeoVS viewing and data management system use a unique fusion of dynamic 3D display technology and traditional 2D to provide system operators with significantly enhanced situational awareness in real time from remote control rooms and also on location at sea by official vessels. The dynamic alert system combines live and historical data to enable multi-level automated and continuous monitoring of all maritime activity with predefined events and patterns triggering clearly defined action alerts. The system delivers significant operational efficiencies within a cost effective package.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Simon Tucker, CEO of SRT, said:<br \/>\n<\/strong>\u201cWe are delighted that another of our validated sales pipeline opportunities, currently valued at approximately \u00a3200 million, has reached the contract implementation phase. We have been working with this customer for over a year, conducting extensive validation trials to ensure that our MDM system meets their demanding requirements within a challenging environment. Maritime domain awareness is now widely recognised as strategically vital, and our MDM system provides a robust, reliable and scalable solution. We now look forward to working closely with this strategic customer to implement this first phase over the next year and into the future as they continue to evolve and build their new maritime security and safety apparatus.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>SRT, the AIM-quoted provider of maritime domain awareness systems, is pleased to announce that it has signed a contract to supply a national AIS Maritime Domain Management (MDM) system worth approximately US$5.0 million.
